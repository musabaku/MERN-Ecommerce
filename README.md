# MERN-Ecommerce

MERN-Ecommerce
Overview
MERN-Ecommerce is an ecommerce web application built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This project is a work in progress and contributions are warmly welcomed.

Technologies
This application is developed using JavaScript and the MERN stack, which includes:

MongoDB: Our chosen NoSQL database for storing product, user, and order information.
Express.js: The web application framework for Node.js that we use for building our API.
React.js: This JavaScript library allows us to construct user interfaces for the frontend.
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime that powers our backend, built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Project Structure
Backend Structure
The backend of our application is organized into several key components:

Config: This folder contains configuration files for various aspects of the application.
Controllers: These define the application's route handlers.
Middleware: This folder contains middleware functions for handling requests.
Models: Here you'll find the data models for the application.
Routes: This is where the application's API endpoints are defined.
Utils: This contains utility functions that are used throughout the application.
app.js: This file initializes the Express app and middleware.
database.js: This manages the connection to the MongoDB database.
server.js: This is where the server starts and listens for incoming requests.
Unfortunately, due to technical issues, we are unable to provide the structure of the frontend at this moment.

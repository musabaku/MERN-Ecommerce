# MERN-Ecommerce

MERN-Ecommerce
About
MERN-Ecommerce is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) aiming to provide a complete ecommerce solution. This project is still under development and contributions are welcome.

Technology Used
The application is developed entirely in JavaScript, leveraging the power of the MERN stack. This includes:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing product, user, and order data.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API.
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for the backend.
Project Structure
Backend
The backend of the application is organized into several main components:

Config: Contains configuration files for different aspects of the application.
Controllers: Defines the application's route handlers.
Middleware: Contains middleware functions for handling requests.
Models: Defines the data models for the application.
Routes: Defines the application's API endpoints.
Utils: Contains utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
app.js: Initializes the Express app and middleware.
database.js: Handles the connection to the MongoDB database.
server.js: Starts the server and listens for incoming requests​1​.
Frontend
The frontend structure is currently unavailable due to technical issues, but it follows the standard structure of a React application.
